README:

For this to work, you need pyenv. Install it following a manual or auto-install>
Other than that, it's slow, but will automatically install the needed
python versions and create temporary environments for commands.

this is mainly made in python as a cool CS beginner project.

idk how github works tbh i prolly messed smth up
