README:

For this to work, you need pyenv or another virtual envelope module if not using the sh file. Install it following a manual or auto-install
Other than that, it's slow, but will automatically install the needed
python versions and create temporary environments for commands.

this is mainly made in python as a cool CS beginner project.

idk how github works tbh i prolly messed smth up

USAGE FOR POSIX/UNIX: For linux and possibly MacOS, you simply need pyenv and the .sh file, MAC M1 HARDWARE WILL NOT WORK WITH THIS SCRIPT, you must change the python version in the script to 3.10. ./guitar.sh "<input file>" "<output file>"
*the python file is compatible, but does everything for you.

USAGE FOR WINDOWS: From my experiences, you need the same dependencies for both modules but on different versions. I use subprocess to circumvent this, but it may be weird for you. python3 guitar.py "<input file>" "<output file>"
*the more recommended option is to use WSL as this is intended as a UNIX CLI tool.
